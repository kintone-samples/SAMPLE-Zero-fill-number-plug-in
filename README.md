4. Make sure that a number field and text field are placed into the form of an App.
5. From the plug-in settings, set the number and text fields, as well as the number of digits you'd like the zero-filled number to have. 
6. Create a new record and enter in a number into the number field. The text field will reflect the same number with zeros filled into the beginning to make the number the designated number of digits.
